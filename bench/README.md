# Benchmarks

Run `npm run benchmark` to compile the library and execute `benchmarks.ts`, which compares insertion latencies, iterator performance, and diff throughput for multiple node sizes. Results print to stdout. Modify `benchmarks.ts` if you need custom scenarios; the script already exercises `BTree` and `AdvancedBTree` implementations.
