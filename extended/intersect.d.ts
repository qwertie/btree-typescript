 * Returns a new tree containing only keys present in both input trees.
 * Neither tree is modified.
 *
 * Let `N` and `M` be the input sizes, `I` the number of keys present in both trees, `U = N + M - 2I`
 * the number of keys present in exactly one tree, `H` the larger tree height, and `G` the number of maximal
 * runs of keys belonging exclusively to one particular tree in merged key order. With a fixed max node size
 * and normally occupied nodes, the complexity is `O(min(I + U, I + G * H))`.
 * @param treeA First tree to intersect.
 * @param treeB Second tree to intersect.
 * @param combineFn Called for keys that appear in both trees. Return the desired value.
 * @returns A new tree populated with the intersection.
 * @throws Error if the trees were created with different comparators.
