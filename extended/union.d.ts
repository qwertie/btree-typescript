import BTree from '../b+tree';
/**
 * Efficiently unions two trees, reusing subtrees wherever possible.
 * Neither input tree is modified.
 * @param treeA First tree to union.
 * @param treeB Second tree to union.
 * @param combineFn Called for keys that appear in both trees. Return the desired value, or
 *        `undefined` to omit the key from the result. Note: symmetric difference can be achieved by always returning `undefined`.
 * @returns A new BTree that contains the unioned key/value pairs.
 * @description Complexity is bounded O(N + M) for both time and allocations.
 * However, it is additionally bounded by O(log(N + M) * D) where D is the number of disjoint ranges of keys between
 * the two trees. In practice, that means for keys of random distribution the performance is O(N + M) and for
 * keys with significant numbers of non-overlapping key ranges it is O(log(N + M) * D) which is much faster.
 * The algorithm achieves this additional non-linear bound by skipping over non-intersecting subtrees entirely.
 * Note that in benchmarks even the worst case (fully interleaved keys) performance is faster than cloning `this`
 * and inserting the contents of `other` into the clone.
